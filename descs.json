While W3C spec is related to web, it does not follow it's recommendation: all provided sources use cursor pointer for buttons on their web pages, some of them for checkboxes (ex.: Apple, Microsoft, W3C).\nThere are some issues with having  for links but not for buttons.\n\nIt's usual to have controls in forms like this:\n\n<button class='btn btn-primary' type='submit'>Save</button>\n<a class='btn btn-secondary' href='/back'>Cancel</a>\nThis way both controls looks the same, but have different cursors. This looks inconsistent.\n\n is good example when it's not clear if element is interactive or not: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#external-content\n\nWhy desktop application design guides should not be used for web pages?\nThe main difference is that web-page contains mostly static content (not-interactive) but desktop app usually almost totally interactive (this should be considered in global scale, not for single web-site that can be fully interactive: users use browser to visit different web-sites). So it has become usual to use pointer cursor to help users distinguish interactive elements on webpages.

In my current project, we use AngularJS, where the invalid class is , so I want to re-use this mixin to have that class instead of . I could copy the selectors, but if those change, my code will fail.\nI saw similar issues with several other mixins, where they are too spicific to easily be re-used. I think this is bad practice, and the framework would benefit from a more general approuch. You can use optional arguments for the default, so I don't see a reason to not make them better re-usable.\nSo this is a feature request to update this mixin in order to re-use it for other purposes.\n", "\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/webpack/\nSuggests:\n\nThis a great starting point. Autoprefixer is required because the scss files don't include the vendor prefixes, so we need postcss. But I did wonder why the \"precss\" plugin is also suggested. As I understand it precss allows some \"scss-like\" mixins, variables, etc with slightly different syntax. Surely this is already covered by sass-loader which compiles the provided scss files? And because sass-loader runs first, it has already compiled all those scss features. So precss => NOP?\nI tested with and without precss. The only difference in output appears to be that precss strips the :root { ... list of custom css variables ... } and formats the bulk of the css with multiple selectors per line. The official dist css files do have the custom css vars. They are not actually used anywhere, and would not work in IE11 anyway, but might be useful for reference from any custom js?\nSo: \"less is more\" ?\nSuggest removing \"precss\" plugin from this suggested webpack config.\n", "\nWhen hovering over a select that is placed in a 's  then the height of the corresponding  increases.

But when grouping buttons in a btn-group it is problematic because it leads to consecutive \"pressed\" buttons having overlapping shadows.\nYou can try for you self in the docs:\nhttps://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#checkbox-and-radio-buttons\nOr use this modified docs code for test case\n\nWhen you select multiple buttons in this case you get overlap of the shadows leading to ugly darker blocks near the edges of the buttons.\nNote: Definitely a duplicate of #24711 but can't reopen and realize it closed comments probably won't be seen so opening a new issue with a more clear purpose.\n", "\nHello.

When the modal is opened, the navbar content is slightly shifted to the left. I have tried it with cards/cols as well, where the same issue applies.\nThe code that applies the padding-right to elements with sticky-top class can be found in PR #23669 (Fix sticky margin when a modal is opened).\nVersion stats:\nOperating system: Ubuntu 16.10\nBrowser version: Chrome Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nBootstrap version: 4.0.0-beta\n", "\nThe Examples and About links open the 404 page.\n", "\nFrom @tomscholz's comment.\n\nWhat about using greenkeeper.io to automate dependencies updates?\n\n", "\nHi, i checked page wiht BS4 on IE 10, windows 10.

Now that it's easier to create re-usable components and even manage layouts responsively using JS I find myself fighting the mobile-first/responsive functionality and state-management that's forced upon me via BS4.\nSome examples of pain points:\n\nNavigations now require you to use a helper class to automatically collapse - \nCards automatically wrap around as the screen gets smaller\nForm styling depends on a specific ordering of DOM due to sibling selectors like:\n\n.invalid-feedback {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n.form-control {\n  &.is-invalid {\n    ~ .invalid-feedback {\n      display: block;\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe above makes it difficult to componentise things without having an exact structure of DOM:\n<input type=\"text\" myValidationClasses>\n<my-errors [ctrl]=\"form.controls.amount\">\n  <div class=\"invalid-feedback\">Required</div>\n</my-errors>\nBS3 had direct-child selectors for things like navigations, which made it difficult for Angular because you had to do a lot of wrapping for conditionally displaying DOM. Now BS4 is enforcing siblings for state-management.\nA couple of years ago all of this was excellent because state management and responsive sites required a lot of work and were difficult when the server-generated your DOM. Nowadays I'd just be happy with having a CSS framework that looked great out of the box, but allowed me to manage state/responsiveness myself.\nWhat I'd like to see:\n\nResponsive/mobile-first split away (at least different SCSS files so I can choose to not include them)\nState management split away (things like  and sibling-selection to display things)\n\nWould you accept PRs for stuff like this or does it go against where you'd like Bootstrap to be in the FE space?\n", "\nAs explained quite clearly on this article, hand (pointer) cursor should be limited to links on text and images.\nThe rule seems to be: for a button, there is no need to use a pointer cursor. for a text link, a pointer cursor should be used.\nCurrently, the underlying element is not altered: if you render a classic link as a button ( with ) the cursor is still a hand cursor.\nFor example, in the documentation for the first button.

Although this is just as simple as before, this is far from ideal, since now  isn't necessarily blue anymore.\n2 - Override part of the color system that is referenced in the  map. This works better than the first solution, but requires you to redefine variables only so that they can be referenced successfully in the  map, which is kind of ugly...\n\nAlthough this is not a huge issue, it is quite inconvenient nonetheless.

My suggestion would be able to set a max search depth.\nSecond problem is potential nested accordions. Although the parent selector could be the anchor to all other accordion events, which means the nested accordion would not get toggled unless they share the same parent id.\nA side benefit, this would greatly open the opportunity to sidebar menus with accordion collapse behaviors.\nConcerns\nWhile I understand the need for performance to avoid having to traverse all parent to child nodes, a compromise could be made to allow a certain search depth. Also jQuery find(), used in some of the Bootstrap Source Javascript files, once traversed the DOM and selectors discovered is cached.\n", "\nVersion 4\nIf the anchor URL is lazy loaded into it (which is common if you are using e.g. angular or react), the buttons don't have  on page load for some time and because of this style buttons  the text color for sometime and look ugly, it would be great if there was a way to disable this style inheritance on specific anchor tags.\n\n", "\nSo I have a nav and corresponding tab panes.

Because this is supported right now in modern / dev-used browsers, it also brings a newish component to live editing via the Inspector.\nCompatibility: in the event that someone is already using custom properties named the same as the bootstrap variables, then this would only affect them if the bootstrap ones come after their own (otherwise the cascade would take care of it).

So I'd like to show some animation in that time, to let the user know that the action was indeed triggered. Once the progress is strictly over 0%, then I would go back a more normal look. And my idea to give this feedback of indeterminate state is with the following CSS style:\n\nSo, width 100%, faded+animated. With the gray style and full-width progress bar, I would be a pretty good indeterminate state, I think.\nObviously the issue for me is that bg-faded doesn't exist for the progress bar :-)\nSo the question is, do you think it would make sense to add it for that purpose, or you see it as a hack and don't want to add it?\nEDIT: aha I think I can achieve that myself by overriding the  to lightgray or something of the sort.

Font-resizing is needed to make large texts readable on all devices and to prevent longer words and compounds to fall off screen.\nIt's currently possible to alter the font-size of the html element with media queries (see Responsive typography), but this method can cause the font-size of text to be too small on mobile devices.\nRFS can solve this by because this mixin automatically calculates the appropriate font-size based on the width of the device.\nExample problem with bigger font-sizes:\nhttp://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/narrow-jumbotron/\nRFS solution:\nhttp://martijncuppens.github.io/rfs/docs/4.0/examples/narrow-jumbotron/\nBootstrap implementation demo:\nhttp://martijncuppens.github.io/rfs/\nGithub page:\nhttps://github.com/MartijnCuppens/rfs\nPull request\n#23816\n", "\nNow i cant pass a few breakpoints like this:\n@include media-breakpoint-only(xs sm lg) {\n  text-transform: capitalize;\n}\nI have to duplicate same rule:\n@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {\n  text-transform: capitalize;\n}\n@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) {\n  text-transform: capitalize;\n}\nSo cumbersome and inconvenience...\n", "\nI just wrote a small debugging label indicating the current breakpoint as follows:\n\nThis shows the current breakpoint fine, except XS: there's are no classes called  or .\nThis is actually preventing me from defining my own custom breakpoint such as XXS and being able to test it.

First time reporting an issue on GitHub.\nBut it was previously reported that there was an issue with images stretching in cards. If the images width was smaller than the container, the image would stretch to fill the container while maintaining the same height. With the latest build they set the width to 100% so it stretches the image to fill the card while maintaining aspect ratio. One problem with this is if you have a bad link, which I'm assuming is showing up as really thin and tall, it stretches it out to 100% width while maintaining aspect ratio, which makes a really tall image.\nA solution I found that works better is to just put the image in a div and set the max-width of the image to 100%. You can set the div to text-align center to center align it. You can have smaller images that just don't take up the entire width or larger images if you want to fill the entire card, either way it maintains aspect ratio and you don't get any funky behaviors.\n", "\nI need to separate a checkboxes label and input to conform with django forms.

There are actually two reasons for this: the margin applied to the .custom-control, and the padding applied to the .custom-control.\nThe margin comes about because of #21295\nNow, this isn't too bad to \"overcome\" by just using m-0 class on the .custom-control.\nHowever, the padding just doesn't make sense to me why it's that way to begin with. Since the \"custom-control-description\" class is already documented, why not apply the padding to this element instead?

In hope to save others the time, I thought i'll share the final recipe -\nstart by installing bootstrap in your project -\n\n(notice bootstrap has two dependencies - jquery and tether. If you would rather have explicit versions of those two, you should install them as well)\nimport bootstrap's javascript through index.js -\nimport 'bootstrap';\n(i'm assuming you're using es6, in case of es5, use )\nThe previous line will only import the js part of bootstrap. for the styling part you have two options -\n1. Precompiled SASS\nInside one of your sass files (index.scss for example) add this line -\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss\";\n(notice the ~ (tilde) which points to the node modules folder)\nThis mehtod is beneficial if you plan on using your own version of the wonderful _variables file bootstrap comes with. just make sure you import _variables before bootstrap. Also, now you can use all the cool mixins bootstrap has.\n2. Compiled CSS only\nIf you're not planning on using the variables or the mixins, and prefer the precooked css file, simply add this line to index.js or any other js file -\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\n(btw - you can also import this way the sass file, but it's nicer to import it via another sass file as shown in pervious mehtod)\nnow comes the webpack part. for jquery and tether to be available as a global variable throughout the project, you'll have to add this to your webpack plugins sections -\nnew webpack.ProvidePlugin({ // inject ES5 modules as global vars\n  $: 'jquery',\n  jQuery: 'jquery',\n  'window.jQuery': 'jquery',\n  Tether: 'tether'\n})\nThe different jquery definition are meant to answer requirements of different libraries (for example angular looks for 'window.jQuery'). I'm assuming your webpack.config already has rules for scss and/or css.\nAnd that's it! now you have bootstrap in your webpack project.\nLet me know if any further explanation is needed, and if anyone knows of a better way, please share.\n", "\nHi!

See comment\nThe original feature request and PR attempt to warn the user when he call the component API repeatedly instead of waiting for and even before making the next call.\nEven though this behavior is expected and documented. See comment\nIt worth noting that the previous behavior (skip the call if it's transitioning) is quite common and most framework works this way and expect the developer to understand the notion of asynchronous.\nUnfortunately, with the current implementation (#17823) it seems we have inadvertently  created more problems than we solved... In addition we have added some complexity to the code, and it seems difficult to anticipate all the potential problem that will be found.\nHere is a few solutions I can think of.\n1 - Revert #17823 and improve the documentation by adding a clear warning on each transition-capable module page and add more examples of events handling\n\n(+) Remove the added complexity\n(+) Work similarly to other framework that deal with asynchronous methods\n(+) Avoid any future issues along the lines of (#21600, #21607, #21704)\n(-) Even with a big warning on each module page in the docs, we might still have tickets like #17796\n\n2 - Improve #17823 to throw an exception only when the call has been made from the API (and not from a trigger element)\n\n(+) Solve #17800 and avoid tickets like #17796\n(-) Keep the added complexity\n(-) Might still create unexpected issues in cases where we mix API call and element trigger\n(-) Might still create unexpected \"module interaction\" issues like in #21607\n\n3 - Allow a method call or a trigger event on the JS components to cancel an on-going transition and a new one\n\n(+) Solve #17800 in way that doesn't produce console error and provide a good user experience\n(+) Tooltips and Popovers already work that way\n(-) Difficult to implement for modal as a call to  start 2 successive transitions (backdrop then the modal itself. It would require to distinguish which transition is on going and react differently.\n(-) Extremely difficult to implement for the Carousel component. As the items move independently, it would require to adapt the transition speed of each item based on their position when the transition is canceled\n(-) Overall add a lot of complexity and risks for regression\n\nFeel free to propose and discuss other potential solutions.\nMy hunch is that solution 1 (revert and document) might be better. The problem we try to solve is related to developers who do not read the docs or understand asynchronous functions. It feels like this issue is better solved by improved documentation, especially when the \"code solution\" create issues for the end user.\nAnd I think the doc can be improved in that regard.\nThe problem I see with the \"code solution\" is that it will either create a constant source of bugs or become extremely complicated in order to handle every possible case.

This works very well, but we are running into issues when it comes to more complex, responsive components. When building a component, we don't know in which context the component will be used later. Especially regarding the size of the parent container where it will be embedded in the target application.\nThe following picture tries to explain the issue. Component A is used in two containers which have a different width. Component A wants to react to the different container sizes and display itself according to the available space. But this is not possible with the Bootstrap grid system, because it relies on media queries which always target the whole screen or iframe and not the size of the container. That means, e.g. the same col-* classes will be active for the small and the large version of Component A at the same time, making it impossible to show a small and a large version of Component A.\n\nThe main issue lies within the nature of CSS media queries. This is a general issue when developing reusable responsive components. There are some alternative approaches like Element Queries. but it's far from a web standard and has its own drawbacks. Therefore we developed a small extension to the existing Bootstrap grid. Note that this solution is still based on Bootstrap v3 but it shows the approach and should be easily adaptable for v4.\n\nThis extension is used/activated by simply applying the  class to the parent container so all the grid classes respond to the  size class instead of the media queries of the standard Bootstrap grid. This allows to apply the  classes in whichever way makes sense for the application. Most likely it will be applied via JavaScript as a result of a  event handler.\nThe biggest limitation of this solution is that it is not working recursively which could become a problem when components are containing other components.\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and get some feedback if possible. It would be awesome to get a proper solution for this in Bootstrap v4 as component development will become more and more important.\n", "\nIssue can be validated here:\n\nNavigate to http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/\nSearch for \"Launch demo modal\" and click on that.

Bootstrap's event handler calls event.preventDefault() (button.js line 142) which will prevent the label from triggering the subsequent click event on the checkbox element.\nThis seems a bit intrusive and may require existing JS to be re-written. In my own case I already have code adding event listeners to input elements, both where inputs and labels are peers and where labels envelop inputs, as required by Bootstrap.

With dropdowns, we also need to have a separate class that is added to the parent or menu to properly show that.\nMy proposal is this:\n\nLet's allow this to be flexible for any markup by applying the  class only to the item itself, and not the parent.\nNav links, list group items, and dropdown triggers get  on the  or  for their active state.\nDropdown triggers get  to indicate their associated menu is shown, and the  gets  to indicate it is visible.\n\nThat last part is a deviation from the current behavior, and might require more work.

There has to be a more accessible way to achieve the goals set out by this helper function than to constantly steal focus.\nProposed Solution\nI propose bootstrap modal needs a distinct model of the UI in order to handle events in an accessible and modular style, otherwise it will fundamentally be incompatible with other UI components in unpredictable ways.\nObserved Behavior\nWhen hosting a select2 widget in a bootstrap4 modal, select2 works correctly in IE but does not work in Chrome.\nTroubleshooting\nAfter digging into the code, it became clear that Chrome was functioning \"correctly\" and the real problem was in bootstrap modal's use of an enforceFocus() helper.  select2 controls inside the modal try to get focus, and the modal outer component steals it away.  This is due to the fact select2 is attached directly to the body element  [1] , which is the most logical place for third-party controls (e.g. select2) to cache DOM nodes while knowing nothing about the app consuming its behavior.  Since select2's DOM nodes are not nested inside the modal but transposed on top via fancy logic, enforceFocus() thinks the user is performing some action outside the modal.\n[1] https://github.com/select2/select2/blob/4.0.2/src/js/select2/dropdown/attachBody.js\nTest Details:\n\nIE 11.0.9600.18314 w/ 11.0.31 (KB3154070) update\nChrome 50.0.2661.102 m\n\nExample\nhttp://jsbin.com/viwizoyofe/2/edit?html,js,output\nExample Walk-through Explanation\n\nGo to the Output pane.\nClick the dropdown that says red.\nObserve that, since bootstrap does not yet see this dropdown as inside a modal dialog, auto-complete inside the control works fine.\nClick \"Convert to popup\", which will trigger bootstrap to see this dropdown as inside a modal dialog.\nClick the dropdown that says red, again.\nObserve that, since bootstrap sees this dropdown as inside the modal dialog, auto-complete stops working.\n\nWhen something tries to set focus on anything that is outside of the modal dialog, Bootstrap Modal will return focus to the whole dialog. Incidentally, the dropdown that Select2 creates is outside of the modal dialog (appended to ), including the .  When you open the dropdown, Select2 tries to set focus to the , and Bootstrap Modal immediately returns focus to the dialog, leaving  focus-less and unable to receive keystrokes.\nThis autocomplete works before you click the link once, because at that point there is no modal dialog.  The element itself exists, but Bootstrap Modal doesn't see it as a modal dialog yet.\nThis complete example shows that there is nothing wrong with select2 itself, and the problem resides solely in Bootstrap Modal stealing focus.  This can be further verified using the following Chrome Debugger steps:\n\nClick the \"Convert to Popup\" link once.\nOpen Dev Tools -> Sourcs -> bootstrap.js -> search for _enforceFocus, set a breakpoint on the innermost statement (for me its line 1910).\nClick Select2, see the breakpoint hit.\nResume execution\nClick the  within the Select2 dropdown, see the breakpoint hit again.\n\nI'm not 100% sure why IE11 allows Select2 to work within Bootstrap Modal, but it could be that IE11 doesn't let you set focus from within a \"focus changed\" event handler or some such.  The dangers of an infinite loop when doing so are even attempted to be handled by Bootstrap Modal, with the following code:\n\nProposed Solution\nIt would probably be best if we just removed the enforceFocus() helper altogether.  There don't seem to be any unit tests that actually test this behavior  [1]  and it's impossible to the naive consumer to predict which components will work well with it.  Even more troubling, IE [11.0.9600.18314 w/ 11.0.31 (KB3154070) update] does not respect enforceFocus() and so it gives the appearance to the client user, comparing IE and Chrome, that there is a \"bug\" in Chrome.\n[1] https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/js/tests/unit/modal.js\nWorkaround\nI ended up just using tether directly and writing my own TypeScript-based PopupViewModel that attaches to document.body.

Contextual digit shaping is a very important feature as the Arabic users don\u2019t expect to see Arabic-Indic numerals or European numerals only when they have mixed English and Arabic data.\nFor example if a document has many paragraphs some in Arabic and others in English, in the Arabic paragraphs the Arabic users expect to see national or Arabic-Indic numerals, and in the English paragraphs the Arabic users expect to see European numerals.\nSince the mixed English and Arabic data cases are very common in Arabic region, the same case with numerals is very common too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sample communication thread using IBM Lotus Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sample Arabic and English list of references.\n\nArabic paragraphs that list references\u2019 names(which include numerals) are very common for Arabic users as well. In that case the Arabic users expect to see the numerals as European not Arabic-Indic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sample Arabic paragraph where users expect to see European numerals.\n\n\nSo direct conversion of digits from latin to national will not fulfil Arabic users\u2019 needs.\nContextual behavior is the core numeric shaping option that is needed from the Arabic users\u2019 point of view.\n\n# About how to do that at Bootstrap:\nI will add a function at each js file under JS folder to support digit shape at each component\nAnd the core numeric shape js file will be placed at a separate util module\n", "\nTether js for dropdowns?\nI like the improvements Tether provides for tooltips/popovers in bootstrap v4. Is there a reason it was not implemented for dropdowns?\nThis would help with having dropdowns flow outside of overflows, as well as positioning.\nExample:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/719media/0f8vc7td/\nThe idea here is that I should not have to write custom event handlers to capture the dropdowns and introduce tether.\n", "\nSticky table headers are a key concept on all mobile platforms. Since the display sizes are quite small, you usually can't see the table header any more if the height of the table is bigger than the height of the screen. The project stickyRows gives a good demonstration of what I mean.\nThis project is a bit too complicated though, because it includes handling of different types of table headers and stacking of those. What I think should really be part of Bootstrap 4, is a class like  (similarly to ) that you can add to each  and then Bootstrap does the rest and always keeps the current -section on the top until the last row scrolled to the top or the next -section goes up.\n", "\nThe reason why it is matters to do something like pointer-events: none for tooltips and popovers is: when you have many objects with tooltips and they are located close to each other, when you are moving mouse from one object to another you have a chance to \"hit\" the tooltip while it is disappearing (with fade animation). In this case the new tooltip will not be shown for sure, even if you will drag a mouse over the new object.\n", "\nThe documentation for forms under the 'Using the grid' section suggests using the following code:\n\nThe horizontal padding on the  is less than the negative margin on the row, so labels don't line up correctly with the grid.\n", "\nI was thinking, a lot of people do not need all of what bootstrap has to offer. And some might want a subset of classes from a module. Take for instance if my app has no need for the outline buttons.\nI am aware there are tools that exist which will scan over your site and find usage and report accordingly. But it would be a cool feature to have.\nThe idea is that every class definition would use the placeholder syntax, then in the variables we have a list of all classes to hoist, which we then loop over and create by extending the placeholder.\n\nThe only pain would be maintaining this list.\nCurious on other people's thoughts.\n", "\nI've built my career around Bootstrap, developing and maintaining Bootstrap Material Design. Recently I've started working with BS v4, particularly with the new tooltips and popovers powered by Tether.js.\nI rapidly got frustrated by them for several reasons...\nThat inspired me to create Popper.js, a library to manage tooltips, popovers, dropdowns and so on.\nIt's the result of several years of experience with complex web interfaces which heavily use \"poppers\" for UX purpose and it spots a long list of features including:\n\nhalf the size of Tether.js (just ~3.5KB);\nNo CSS dependencies;\nNo dependencies required;\nSupports automatic detection of the tooltip size (included its arrow) to correctly position the tooltip near its reference element, without need to specify offsets manually;\nIt's fully tested by Karma + Jasmine;\nWhen you scroll, you don't notice any lag in the popper movement;\nYou can append your tooltip element on any element in the page, not just the  (and everything will still work properly);\nPopper.js, has automatic support for tooltip element creation. You can define its content, the markup of its arrow and everything you'd expect;\nIt supports a plugin system you can use to customize the behavior of the library;\nParticular \"flip\" behaviors are supported, for example if there's not enough space on the left, you can ask the popper to be placed on the bottom of the reference element;\nThe whole code is fully documented using JSDoc;\nLicensed under MIT;\nupdate:\nWritten in ES6;\nIncludes a side library almost identical to the tooltip.js library of Bootstrap;\nActive community with responsive maintainers;\nPerformance optimizations such as 60fps throttling and passive events support;\nAbsolutely clear code base, easy to modify and patch;\n placement option;\n\nI\u2019d love for you to check out my library and integrate it with Bootstrap V4.\nHere the link to the demo page:\nhttp://popper.js.org/\nand of the GitHub repo:\nhttps://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js\nWould you be open to a PR?\nPlease reach out to me with feedback our questions about Popper.js!\nUpdate:\nThe library has been rewritten in ES6 and its API improved (also, more features have been added), we are finalizing it.\nRight now we are writing a side-library with an API very similar to the one used by Bootstrap tooltips, once it will be ready we'll release the new version.\nThis is being done because our plan is to first replace Tether.js with Popper.js in Bootstrap Material Design v4 to prove the quality of the library and the ease of integration of it.\nPopper.js has been successfully adopted by Atlassian and by Le Roy Merlin and both are really happy with it.\nUpdate 2:\nPopper.js V1 has been released along with Tooltip.js, I worked to improve the code quality and now it scores 4/4 on Code Climate and 99 on bitHound.\nI also added code coverage reports and it's at 91% right now (actually a bit more, but Karma doesn't properly merges the code coverages from IE10)\nWe added much more tests, we now have around 150 tests ran on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE10, IE11 and Edge.\nCompanies like Microsoft in WebClipper and Atlassian are using it in production and they are very happy! \ud83c\udf89\n", "\nhttp://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/\nie.  not used any more. but not mentioned anywhere\n", "\nOn page\nhttp://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/\nlinks Reboot, Grid only, Flexbox are broken - href=\"#\".\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qSWksCi.png\n", "\nBootstrap tooltips work well with inline SVG images.\nBut I have a trouble with tooltip on SVG symbol image in fiefox.\nAt first sight it work.

If there is a different attribute other than , that'd be fine too.\nI'd be happy to make a pull request, just let me know.\n", "\nI'd like to better understand whether the existing v4 margin and padding classes as well as hx, p, etc. elements are going to remain the same or be adjusted at some point. The reason I ask is because it's practically impossible to get a content section with equal whitespace if a user is allowed to make any determination of which tags get used. This was the case with v3 as well. I'd love to see some consistency or at least better understand the reasoning behind these things.\nIn v4, it looks like the following is the case:\n\nh1-h6 tags have their top-margin removed altogether. Is the assumption that each developer will set their own margins in their project? I can't imagine not wanting any top margin on hx tags, although I'd prefer they were consistent across all hx tags.\nh1-h3? tags have 8px bottom margin while p tags have 16px bottom margin. What is the reasoning on this? Wouldn't it be better to have them the same? 8px is pretty short and 16px is pretty tall.\nThe new padding and margin classes end up being 16px, 32px, and 48px. Those don't align with the bottom margins above.\n\nSo there is no way to get a content area with equal whitespace on all sides without completely overriding everything.\nIn addition, containers and rows have 15px of whitespace, but gutter margins are 35px (although I get this probably has more to do with math than for the above items). Regardless, it really complicates things with trying to get consistent horizontal and vertical spacing.\nIn v3, things were/are still out of alignment:\n\nh1-h3 tags have a top-margin of 22px and a bottom margin of 11px.\nh4-h6 tags have a top-margin of 11px and a bottom margin of 11px.\np tags have a bottom margin of 11px.\n\nLet me provide an example. Let's say we just want equal top and bottom \"whitespace\". We'll forget about horizontal space for now. The new margin and padding classes don't allow us to deal with the 8px bottom margin of hx tags at all.\nI haven't completely thought through the perfect answer for this. Probably something like all hx tags having 16px top margin and 8px margin. Have all p and other tags have 8px bottom margin (or at least some consistent value). That way we could at least adjust the bottom whitespace of the div itself to get an even 16px on top and bottom. Of course we could then increase the whitespace on all sides of the div to get to other multiples, like 32px.\nAt any rate, I figured you guys were either still thinking this through and open to changes or had a really good explanation for why the values are set the way they are.\n", "\nHello, I've just migrated form bootstrap 3 and now I'm using the all new Bootstrap's 4 cards.

All divs now show at once:\n\nChrome does not report decimal viewport widths even when zoomed, I assume it rounds the values when applying media queries.\nWhile the problem can be avoided by only ever using either max or min media queries, much of Bootstrap's default css uses both (such as navbar, which suffers from this same problem).\nI would also expect non-100% zoom levels on browsers are becoming more common as high DPI screens become more common.

Currently it is rather painful to get the dependencies working properly when trying to minimize global variables and it's pretty much impossible to hand pick the features you want (without hacking on the source).\nSolving #17325 is relatively easy to handle: adding ,  and adding both of those to . The tricky part comes when the user needs (or wants) a bit more control over the Bootstrap modules. Bootstrap has always* been automagical: you add the  file and suddenly you have all the features the framework uses at hand through the HTML markup binding. Or you could just use the provided JS API's.\nAs modular JavaScript has gotten more and more popular in the past few years, the developers have gotten accustomed to fine-grained control over the source files, into a situation where not everything has to be dumped to the page and then it just works. Like in #17325 (comment), the obvious choice would be allowing to import the files one by one and use them as you want to:\n\nIn my bs-modules branch this sort of works right now:  will be modal and Popover will be popover. The real issues begin here:\nIIFE's and re-exporting\nAll the components are wrapped in to IIFE's\n\nWhen we re-export the files in index.js the exported files are executed from top to bottom and all of the IIFE's get triggered. Consider something like this:\n\nNot entirely sure what would be the best way to avoid this. Most likely creating some kind of -methods that are IIFE'd in the compiled version () that could be called manually when importing, or\nmaking the end users initialize their own components (through something like .\nPretranspiled or raw sources\nCurrently the distributed modules are transpiled with Babel and wrapped into UMD-wrappers.  file is created by Grunt which requires all the modules. Now the userland can use the modules without transpilation, but if you are creating something this ES2015 this seems a bit redundant as you most likely have your own transpilation process going on. #18934 asks for where the source files are and I agree: the raw sources should be included. Which leads to the question, should the UMD-modules be included too? Some of the options:\n\nOnly offer the raw ES2015 and mention in the docs that transpilation is most likely needed and show ways how to do it\n\nLowest maintenance cost,  modules ===  modules\nConfigure popular bundlers in repo\nMight cause headaches to some end users?\n\n\nOffer ES2015 files and the transpiled ones. UMD files could be imported with  and the ES2015 files \n\nIncreased maintenance cost\nMost robust\n\n\nOffer separate packages for the 2015 and UMD flavours\n\nOpinions?\nAny opinions about either of these or the modularization in ? We are getting quite to the release (or end of the alpha, I assume) and these are quite big choices. Like in #17325 (comment) there was some discussion about people not complaining about the dependencies not being there and @vejersele replying how most people were not using Bootstrap via  because it was hard and that's most likely true. It would be a shame if that happened to  too: I really want to use Bootstrap in most of my projects, but at its current state it's near impossible to get it to integrate with my apps in a way that I would consider somewhat standard.\n", "\nHello,\ntrying to use \"card\" with \"list-group\", but when use card-header the margin-top not removed.\nHere a picture worth a thousand words.\n\n", "\nwish u append to v4\n", "\n3 panels.

One example of this is with the accordion groups/tabs. There is no allowance for intermediary empty elements, so this creates a problem if our generated HTML ends up like\n<div class=\"panel-group\">\n  <uib-accordion-group>\n    <div class=\"panel\">\n      ...\n    </div>\n  </uib-accordion-group>\n  <uib-accordion-group>\n    <div class=\"panel\">\n      ...\n    </div>\n  </uib-accordion-group>\n  ...\n</div>\nThis situation results in third party libraries having to hack around this undesired coupling in a way that goes against consumption in libraries such as Angular. I realize in Bootstrap 4 that implementations are a little different, but a good solution here is important to us. Any guidance/thoughts on the Bootstrap's team's position here is much appreciated.\nReference to issue where this causes problem in Angular 1.x: angular/angular.js#13805\n", "\nThe comments in _reboot.scss says\n\nBy default, - all receive top and bottom margins.

It would be good to get a specific example in the wild of where this is not the case...but also, there's probably little advice we can give/example we can create beyond \"make sure the trigger for your dropdown makes sense...\" which is not something we can mandate at framework level.\n\nProblem 2: these elements are announced as buttons, so Screen Reader users often assume these are action orientated.\n\nAnd they are - the action they perform is to open/close the dropdown menu?\n\nHowever, when these buttons are activated, Screen Reader users are then presented with silence. There is nothing to tell them that the dropdown has now visually opened...\n\nDepending on screen reader, the change in  from false to true will be communicated. Also, the presence of  should have already had some effect in the way the button was announced to indicate it has a menu.\nHowever, the proposed solution of moving focus to the first item when the dropdown is opened is good...for keyboard users. For mouse users, it may look odd, and doesn't match known behavior of something like an actual application menu. May require different code paths for \"opened with a mouse\" vs \"opened with keyboard\", which gets ugly. May need to make a proof of concept to see how jarring it may be.\n\nProblem 3: for keyboard-only users, these dropdowns look similar to select menus, however the dropdown options cannot be accessed by standard select menu keystrokes - like the arrow keys\n\nAlthough we're not strictly following this pattern, it may be worth adding functionality that opens the menu also for up/down arrow (a la http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menu). Once we go down this road, though, other similar keyboard interactions typicially associated with ARIA menus (like arrows to move between menu items etc) will probably also be expected ... but we shied aways from the pattern as dropdowns can be used for things that aren't just traditional ARIA menus.\nI also wonder how prominent a problem this would be, and likely depends again on specific implementation/usage. if the dropdown is part of a navigation bar, users likely won't think it's a select. if it's added as part of a form though, they certainly may...hmmm\n\nProblem 4: when keyboard-only users activate the dropdown, then tab through the dropdown, the dropdown remains \"open\" even after they leave. These dropdowns only close via the button element.\n\nFair point, something we should address. However, once you try and just prevent user from TAB-ing out, what's to stop them using other means of jumping around the page (if they're AT users, e.g. using landmark navigation or similar)?

The public repository can provide users who review the themes and find bugs in the demos to clearly and simply report them, as well as provides a clear point for where users should go when they need support. Contributing.MD doesn't seem to be the right place for that information as the user isn't contributing, they are asking for support which is part of the product.\nThe biggest issue in my opinion with not having a dedicated site or history is that by not answering questions and directing users to email there is no historic base for users to see if others face similar problems and to work together and collaborate. The current posture of the team of using trying to stop users here does nothing in my opinion other than increase frustration of the user opening the issue and those of us that get notifications about issues here. Creating more tension and frustration between the users and core team seems counter-intuitive to me.\nIn addition to this, providing a standalone repository (with a readme, wiki and issues) would provide clearer direction in my opinion (if users find bootstrap-themes repo, I believe they would connect that it makes more sense to open the issue there instead of here). This would allow closed issues for paid users to be directed to the support forum or the team could do a registration that adds them to a standalone twbs-themes organization.

We are very often asked which JavaScript widgets we would advise to use for implementing accessible websites.\nI've done quite some research about accessible tab panels, and the conclusion so far is: none of the tested implementations are fully satisfying in the newest versions of NVDA/JAWS, running on Firefox/IE. So this is quite a pity. (I will publish my results some time soon and link it here.)\nPersonally, I love Bootstrap a lot, and while its JavaScript widgets are pretty well done and working in NVDA, they make problems in JAWS: for example, the accordion works nicely in IE, but it absolutely doesn't work in FF.\nI love how simplistic the ARIA implementations of Bootstrap are. In fact: while ARIA is a good invention, browser support is horrible across operating systems on both desktop and mobile, so I recommend my clients to avoid it in most respects and stick to traditional HTML constructs instead, enhanced with some simple JavaScript.

I reported it to Google Chrome at that time, but to no avail with a fix. I have ran HTML Validation and Lint tests on my one-page website successfully.. As you can see at the bottom page, the accordion produces multiple lines of text overlay inside the panel that is open. It may take a few panel clicks before the bug appears.\n\nBelow are the specs on the browser/OS environment this bug occurs in:\n\nChrome Version 46.0.2490.71 (64-bit)\nOSX Yosemite Version 10.10.5\n\nThe accordion loads fine on Firefox and Safari with the OSX specs above. In an effort to find a potential solution, I've tested it on other devices as well, such as Internet Explorer and mobile devices. The accordion works fine on Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7, Safari browser iOS 9.0.2 on iPhone 6, and Chrome browser Android 5.0.1 on LG G3.\nI've also tried isolating the problem on Codepen, however, the accordion does not dynamically operate (panels remain static) upon importing my original code and the Bootstrap accordion documentation code. I have a repo of the source code here for this particular site in case that helps with seeing the bigger picture.\nAgain, I have tested this on several browsers and devices with the accordion displaying successfully without the multiple text overlay. It is specifically with Google Chrome with the specs bolded above that this bug appears in. My best guess is it may be caused due to having several multiple accordion panels stacked (10 to be exact) and the Chrome browser having trouble rendering the text for each one all at once upon executing the accordion collapse.\n", "\nWhen having a card deck, and each card having an card-img-top, being an img-fluid, the width of the cards are differents, even with same size images.\nA bit hard to explain, see: http://jsbin.com/vuhoqequra/edit?html,output\n", "\nWhen a new modal is opened by a trigger element within the already opened modal (and close the opened one), new and all subsequent modals loose the ability to scroll, instead a background is being scrolled.\nIt is similar to the earlier discussed issue #7501\nSuch behaviour is noticed in bootstrap 3.5.5 but exists since 3.0.0.

While on the surface this change makes sense and the reasoning on the pull is not bad I believe this change should be removed for the following reasons\n\nHandling the click for a disabled button allows the developer to give the user valuable insight into why the button is disabled.\n is a directive which controls behavior and not styling.  Behavior should be handled by Javascript.\n\nOn the first point I think it is valuable to provide feedback when a user clicks a disabled button so that they know why it is disabled.  Think a password change form where the two fields do not match.  When they click submit[1] we can give them the exact reason the form is invalid.  Additionally, this user interaction matches the behavior the user sees if the server needs to do a second level of validation which fails because that happens after clicking the submit button.\nThe second point is perhaps a little, or a lot, dogmatic.  CSS should change only the way the page looks.  It makes things bigger, smaller, flashier, move etc.  In my opinion, and I feel like it is a prevailing view point, CSS should not change the behavior of an element.   is a case where CSS does change behavior by making the button not handle clicks.  It would be better to tell BS users to ignore events in JS if that is the behavior they want since this is a trivial problem.  I have this CSS / JS split so ingrained in my head (as I suspect others do) that I spent load of time trying to figure out why my button was not clickable after upgrading bootstrap.\nAs far as a road forward I would propose that  should allow events since  already exists and will block events.\n[1] Users might notice the button looks disabled but they are still going to click it the best we can do with styling is give the hints at the correct path \ud83d\ude04\nPS: I do apologize for the long issue description.

Looking really nice! I'm especially excited about the new ES6 source code. However, when scanning the source code I noticed that jQuery isn't imported like the other dependencies. Because of this jQuery is also missing in the UMD definitions that are generated via grunt. This causes the UMD modules to be more or less unusable unless you include jQuery globally.\nI guess the reason for this is that it's probably difficult to guess how people are going to import jQuery. Import paths and package names may differ between package managers, etc ...\nHowever, since jQuery is the only external dependency here, I think it should be possible. For example you could ask people using requirejs to define a custom path, which they are probably doing already ...\nOn npm the package for jQuery is 'jquery', so this shouldn't cause any issues. Then the only remaining problem is that babel is converting this:\nimport $ from 'jquery'\nto\nfactory(mod.exports, mod, global.$);\nWhich probably will work, but it is kind of risky to use '$' instead of jQuery I guess ... Maybe there is way to hook into babel's compiling step and change module names there ...\nAdding jQuery as a dependency will also enable people who are already writing ES6 code to actually import the ES6 code ...\nI may be missing a lot of stuff here, so any feedback is more than welcome!\n", "\nBootstrap (/), Documentation and Examples-pages are throwing this:\n\nand as (/) and Examples don't contain a search input element, they are also throwing a searchInputthrowError :\n\n(Searching does seem to work properly on the docs page however)\n", "\nFor example : There are different variation of buttons..\n.btn-lg\n.btn-sm\nFor variation...button's padding,line-height,font size,border radius are changed...\nInstead how about em units\nhtml\n{\n   font-size:16px;\n}\n.btn\n{\n  padding: 1em 1.2em;\n  color: #fff;\n  border-radius: 0.2rem;\n}\nFor .btn-sm , just change its font size\n.btn-sm { font-size: 0.875em }\nWorking with em is a pain ( When nesting elements ) , but code can be reduced ..Its applicable for Buttons , Input box etc...,\nIdea from http://simurai.com/blog/2013/07/03/sizing-components/\n", "\nI wonder why Bootstrap comes without auto-skinning.

I'm not saying at all that you shouldn't be charging anything at all for them (I agree you should and I applaud you for doing it) but is it advantageous for you to offer them at such an inflated price in comparison to a market you've propagated that is getting the best out of the framework as you are?\nI don't want this to come off as picking a fight, I'm genuinely interested as I've been watching the progress of these new themes and am interested in picking one up.

The reason for this is simply because people can more easily recognize what pixel sizes are compared to s and s.\nFor example, everyone knows that a iPad width is 768px. 99% of people aren't going to know what that is in em/rem. But when I look in the V4 source, and I see the the grid sizes for tablet at  I'm like \"uhhh... okay so how wide is that really? Lets see here, assuming 16px base font size, 16*48=768. Oh that means 768px okay\".\nIt's pretty easy in SASS to do a mixin to convert px-to-rem:\n\nIt's very readable. Any developer can look and see that the value is 24px but that SASS is going to convert the final value to . Again, it's easy for developers to visualize what 24px is. It's not easy for developers to visualize what 1.5rem (24/16) looks like...\nAlso, here is proof from the v4 source itself that this should be considered:\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss#L106\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss#L118\nYou are feeling the need to add comments to help people understand how big those s are. Would be a lot more simple to just do:\n\nIt's more readable and results in the same  values in the end.\nSo in short, keep everything in rem's in the end product, yes, but use pixels to get there because it's easier to visualize and more familiar to developers.

Other popular libraries provide this functionality in some way right out of the box.\nExample:\njQuery.fn.jquery\nko.version\nI have run across a use case where I need to be able to do the following:\nWe need to be able to render fragments of HTML into an existing page. To prevent bloating the page and loading the same assets twice without actually knowing anything about the consuming page, I want to from the child fragment HTML detect if these libraries are loaded on the parent page and detect their exact version number for compatibility reasons. Only if a version that isn't compatible is loaded would I then load the required asset.\nWith jQuery and Knockout which are two of the libraries that may already be loaded on my parent page this is trivial but with Bootstrap it is not. The two most popular techniques for detecting the Bootstrap version are:\n\nTo attempt to detect whether its Bootstrap 2 by checking if the typeahead plugin exists. This is not reliable at all and can give a false positive if any jQuery plugin named typeahead is loaded.\nvar bsVersion = ( typeof $.fn.typeahead !== 'undefined' ? '2.3.2' : '3.0.x' );\nTo explicitly load the CSS file as text and parse the comment at the top for the version number. This assumes that we want to detect the version from a known asset. This does not provide the means for detecting the version that may be loaded on the page already (which may be different from the one that you have access to).\n$.get(\"dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\", function (data) {\nvar version = data.match(/v[.\\d]+[.\\d]/);\nalert(version);\n});\n\nI propose that Bootstrap adds something like:\njQuery.fn.bootstrap\nwhich much like jQuery.fn.jquery returns the version number of the library that is loaded.\nI'm not sure what the reason behind putting the version on every plugin explicitly such as Alert.VERSION = '3.3.4' is but it doesn't seem to provide the information without actually creating an instance of that plugin. EDIT: Didn't realize you didn't have to create an instance but in my comment below I expressed that it will only tell you that SOME plugin is loaded named Alert with a VERSION number, not that Bootstrap loaded it.\nI apologize if this has been brought up before as I couldn't find an existing issue.

I am the primary maintainer for the Drupal Bootstrap base-theme. It currently has over 60k installs, so needless to say we get a lot of our own issues.\nRecently, I started the task of trying to tackle better anchor and scrolling support in the base-theme. Support for anchors or scrolling to them has always been a big pain, for not only me, but also a lot of others; especially when dealing with fixed navbars [jsbin].\nThe code I currently have in the project was rather hack-ish and completely un-configurable (my feeble attempt to satisfy a growing issue), so I set out to tackle this once and for all [https://www.drupal.org/node/2462645]. I've poured over countless blogs, docs, support forums and even found a few in this project's issue queue [#193, #1768, #11854].\nThe \"solutions\" vary from CSS to JS, but more often than not require at least some sort of manual configuration for it to work with that specific theme/offset requirement.\nUltimately though, I've determined that a CSS-only solution just doesn't really cut it; especially when dealing with dynamic and varying content as such in CMS framework like Drupal. So, I've created the following JS based plugin instead:\nhttps://github.com/markcarver/bootstrap-anchor [demo/docs]\nIn an effort to offset the \"cost\" for using JS, I was also inspired with the recent addition using anchor.js for Bootstrap's own documentation (#14897, #15491). This got me to thinking how this could easily be expanded from Bootstrap's own Tooltip plugin, like Popovers are. What makes it even more enticing is that there has been a  available to use for quite a while.\nSince both Tooltips and Popovers are completely opt-in with no data API support, it made sense to follow in that direction; especially for those who still want/need a CSS-only solution.\nMy ultimate goal/desire is to merge this upstream into Bootstrap directly. I'm sure this will be a daunting task which is why I'm creating this issue now to get some feedback and eyes on this plugin so it can be flushed out a bit more. I'm still working on documentation of all the new options, so bare that in mind.\nI look forward to y'alls feedback!\n", "\n\n\n\nbootstrap/less/carousel.less\n\n\n         Line 32\n      in\n      2e6511b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .perspective(1000); \n\n\n\n\n ends up compiling (in part) to \nHowever, per the spec and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective , 's value must be either  or a length.

We could start in smaller pockets if necessary.\nI encourage you to play around with the Codepen I linked to so see how the final output looks.

However, to use .container() in my less files, I have to include the whole less/grid.less file that includes the other grid classes. This results in about 30KB of CSS classes being dumped into my compiled CSS that I don't need since I won't be adding them to my HTML tags.\nI can work around this by copying just the .container code to my own file and changing it to just be a mixin, but seems to me that this should be available by default since Bootstrap 3 already includes so much to support semantic markup.\nI think this could be implemented just by moving the code for the .container class to less/mixins/grid.less (adding parentheses to make it a pure mixin of course), re-naming it, and then calling it from less/grid.less for the .container class.\n", "\nIf the modal window is open, and there scrollbar, after the closure of the second modal disappears scrollbar.\nBefore open and close second modal:\n\nAfter open and close second modal:\n\nExample CodePen\nMy fix:\nvar openModalsCount = 0;\n$('.modal').on('shown.bs.modal', function() {\n    openModalsCount++;\n}).on('hidden.bs.modal', function() {\n    openModalsCount--;\n    if (openModalsCount > 0) $('body').addClass('modal-open');\n});\n", "\nThe scenario is.

More precisely:\n      <!-- Static navbar -->\n      <nav class=\"navbar navbar-default\" id=\"navbar\">\n        <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n          <div class=\"navbar-header\">\n            <a href=\"#navbar-collapse\" class=\"navbar-toggle collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"navbar\">\n              <span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span>\n              <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n              <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n              <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\n            </a>\n            <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"#\">Project name</a>\n          </div>\n          <div id=\"navbar-collapse\" class=\"navbar-collapse collapse\">\n            <ul class=\"nav navbar-nav\">\n              <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\n              <li><a href=\"#\">Contact</a></li>\n            </ul>\n            <a class=\"navbar-collapse-close\" href=\"#navbar\">Close menu</a>            \n          </div><!--/.nav-collapse -->\n        </div><!--/.container-fluid -->\n      </nav>\nYou will notice that there is also another anchor after the the . This one is used to create the clickable overlay that will \"close\" (hide) the . I set is  to  so to have somewhere to scroll back (and get focus) when the user closes the menu.\nThe JS-enhanced version uses the collapse.js and transition.js plugins for Bootstrap. I've inlined them because it was the easier way I found to have them included on a JSbin.\nAnd that's all.\n\"What about those \"no-js\" selectors in the stylesheet? We ain't use that in Bootstrap!\"\nThose styles are applied to the CSS-only version, or to the JS-enhanced version before JS runs (or if it fails to run). The selectors prefixed and isolated using the good ol'  trick, so they won't apply when the class is switched to .\nDisclaimer: I don't currently know how progressive enhancement & unobtrusive JS techniques are approached by Bootstrap developers (that is, I don't know \"the Bootstrap way\").\nSo for the sake of these examples, and to make them as clear and obvious as possible, I decided to go with the 'no-js/js' route, which is well known by most web-developers.\nI'll appreciate some feedback in the matter.\nDoes it need any changes or hacks to any Bootstrap file?\nNo, it doesn't.\nIt works with Bootstrap v3.3.2 out of the box. Of course, it requires the use of an  instead of a , but both the Bootstrap CSS and the collapse.js plugin already accept the usage of an  for the \"hamburger\" icon.\nWhat about accessibility?\nI'm not an expert, but I think this approach to navbar-toggle/navbar-collapse might be a bit more accessible than the current way promoted by Bootstrap docs.\nThey work without JS, which I think it's already an instant win when it comes to accessibility. On top of that, the use of an  instead of a  may work as an \"skip-to-navbar\" anchor (in the CSS-only version and/or when JS fails).\nFeedback is welcome.\n", "\nHello\nI am using the Purity III template, corporate layout with 8 custom modules on the homepage.

I understand there is a detailed description, and a live demo, but that doesn't really summarize it succinctly or clearly. Does the plugin just add classes? Does it track scrolling? I think it would be helpful to just add a brief sentence, explaining what it does, along with the statement about the live demo. The live demo is great, but it doesn't really help much because it's ScrollSpy that's doing a lot of that work, not just Affix. It might also help to state here exactly what ScrollSpy is doing and how Affix works with it.\nIn the detailed description it says: \"You must provide the styles for these classes yourself (independent of this plugin) to handle the actual positions.\"  But then, a couple of lines later, it says \"Scrolling past the element you want affixed should trigger the actual affixing. This is where .affix replaces .affix-top and sets position: fixed; (provided by Bootstrap's CSS)\".\n\nIt took me a few minutes to understand those two statements, The first one seems to be saying that the developer has to add positioning, but then it says \"position: fixed\" is added by the class. Seemed contradictory at first. So as I understand it, Affix adds \"position: fixed\", but the developer needs to add the actual numeric offsets. Can you clarify this a little more, maybe specifying that the developer needs to supply the \"top\" values and whatnot?\nSorry if these are two different issues. I can open another one if necessary.\n", "\nThe goal: to have the ability of making mobile-first & mobile-only (?) columns, and easily and transparently \"undo\" them on larger breakpoints.\nAs you all know, currently, Bootstrap lets you make columns starting from the smallest breakpoint you would like those columns to be rendered. For example, if you want a 2-column layout (each column taking up to 50% of the viewport) on every breakpoint, you would use . That mixing would then compile the code necessary for a 2-column layout for the smallest breakpoint and up to the largest one. Similarly, if you want those columns to be rendered only starting from a larger breakpoint, you would then use ,  or , depending at which breakpoint would you like the columns to begin to exist.\nWow, very responsive, such mobile, so first.\nBut what if you would like to achieve the exact opposite. That is, to create columns for smaller breakpoints only, without the need to \"undo\" the (applied) styles on larger breakpoints.\nEnter  and  mixins.\nThe trick is simple, and mobile-first-compatible too: to rely on .\nI've done a really quick & dirty test on my local copy, and so far, it seems to work properly.\nOn , we would then add a few mixins like the followings:\n\n(as you can see, there is some repeated code -properties, mainly- that could probable be abstracted away with some other mixin, but that's another story)\nThe main benefit I see is the ability to easily create rows & columns for narrower viewports and \"revert back\" to full-width on larger viewports, if needed, while avoiding the need of \"undoing\" styles (that is, already applied properties).\nThanks for the feedback.\n", "\nHello Bootstrappers,\nI recently encountered an issue regarding the modal window.

I do want the user to be able to hit the down arrow key while in the field to move to menu items.\nOk, what about those people who do not want the event to be processed by the dropdown? They can use the time-tested and customary method of calling  on the event, either explicitly or by returning  from their event handler if they also want to prevent default handling. There are two examples of this in the bins above. First, there's the  event which has a handler on the input field preventing it from propagating to the dropdown.

In the same fashion, if the button is removed while the tooltip is showing then the tooltip will stick around again.\nI've created a simple jsBin to showcase both scenarios:\n\nThe first two buttons have tooltips. If you click the first, you'll see it stick around while the button is disabled. The third button will disable/enable the first two buttons, so you can click that to re-enable the first and will then be able to remove the tooltip.\nThe second button has a tooltip, and clicking it will remove all the buttons on screen. Doing so will leave the tooltip hanging around and there will be no way to remove it. If you had already disabled the first button by clicking on it, you'll now have two tooltips that will stick around until you refresh.\n\nThe bug does not present itself in Chrome (v39), but does in Firefox (v35).\n", "\nHello.\nYou defined the height of .form-control class:\n\nbut in .btn you didn't defined the height.

The main difference of this library compared to the previous propositions, is that it was important for me to not only use the swipe event as a trigger for sliding the carousel, but also allow users to \"drag\" the items while they's swiping - somewhat similar to how carousels are implemented in many native applications.\nIf you find it interesting, I'd love to add this functionality to the core Carousel class and submit a pull-request.

But it uses Helvetica Neue as the default font, which is neither a web font, nor free ( http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/29619/commercial-use-of-helvetica-neue-for-web ), nor easily install-able ( or even easily removable ), and simply displays horribly in many many circumstances; doesn't distinguish many times between font-weights, doesn't kern well, and is not easily fixable by even experienced users unless hardcoded and replaced with another font.\nDue to this design decision and the popularity of Twitter Bootstrap a lot of websites on the web have adapted in using \"Helvetica Neue\" as the primary font, with fallbacks to Helvetica, Arial and sans-serif.\nIf a version of Helvetica Neue is installed on a non-Mac OS, like e.g. in recent Windows versions; then Helvetica Neue is rendered with a non-web Bold version. Rendering professional websites really ugly. It's not possible to get rid of this font in those versions.\nIt's not possible to 'fix' this, by overwriting this font; and it's not possible to patch it, as this font is not easily downloadable, and has literally hundreds of different versions which all display horribly; and if it's not found, it will default back to the closest font in the family - try them yourself on your website : http://desktoppub.about.com/od/classicfonts/f/How-Many-Helvetica-Names-and-Versions.htm\nIs this issue limited to Twitter Bootstrap? No, this is a font issue. But Twitter Bootstrap sets the web standards with style choices, and the decision that was made early on was to use a non web-safe font as the default font. I personally would expect the default fonts to be chosen so they display safely across the OSes, which most do - except Helvetica Neue.\nThere are even plugins created to automatically alter pages and replace Helvetica Neue with web-safe fonts, that's how bad the situation has become. Even Twitter adds a 'ms-windows' class nowadays to its body, to override Helvetica Neue with Arial ( and later on changed to Gotham as we know ). We are getting back to 'browser detection' ages.\nI would understand if this was a specific website with some corporate design guidelines that would cost millions to change; but it isn't so. And it breaks the functionality that Twitter Bootstrap is promising - beautiful front-end sites across the board, and not only on Macs.\nPlease help in stopping this from spreading, use web-safe fonts as default, instead of licensed OS specific fonts that have a tremendous history of displaying wrongly.\nOne of the worst parts in this is that most people are dumbfounded when confronted with this. Most designers and developers who primarily work on Macs are simply not aware of this, and took it as a quasi-standard. After speaking with a few bigger startups, I got them to at least change their websites and remove it from their list.\nAnd don't misunderstand me please : Helvetica Neue is great; it's a beatiful font. On T-shirts, in banners, on posters, on Macs. But not in web paragraph text for the many non-Mac users; even though your version might look nice right now, the Mac version has great improvements. But shouldn't all of the bootstrap pages look beautiful by default, no matter the system and which fonts are installed?\nhttps://offroadcode.com/blog/1468/why-you-shouldnt-use-helvetica-in-your-css/\nhttp://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141362/whats-wrong-with-the-character-encoding-in-the-blog\n#705\n#3629\n#5297\n#7672\n#10681\n#10574\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/719907/why-isnt-helvetica-neue-rendering-properly\nhttp://rachaelmoore.name/posts/design/css/web-safe-helvetica-font-stack/\nhttp://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2242160\nhttp://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstallingHelveticaNeueFontsWithGoogleChromeOnWindowsConsideredHarmful.aspx\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/joomlabugsquad/Ja2BvatSaNk/2iY6yuRelC8J\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/l5mK6fbPtKY\nhttps://forums.adobe.com/thread/954620\nhttps://forums.adobe.com/thread/1191932\nhttp://blog.webink.com/why-fonts-suck-windows-hinting/\nhttp://www.fastcodesign.com/3031432/why-apples-new-font-wont-work-on-your-desktop\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/VKmbhbQTVFA\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/20p44j/help_installed_helvetica_neue_chrome_wont_stop/\nhttp://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?p=69623757\nPeople hardcoding Arial in their browsers to replace Helvetica Neue\nhttp://biohazardev.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/helvetica-helvetica-neue-fix-for-windows-for-chrome/\nhttp://smuggbugg.com/fix-helvetica-neue-font-issue-chrome/\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/J4dqHZD3dcs%5B51-75-false%5D\nhttp://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/questions/1403608-bunch-of-gibberish-for-font-on-chrome\nPeople installing specific extensions just to solve this\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/37774/kill-helvetica\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-font-family-style/aabledekpjmoghdjnpnhfkfpmjifklpb\nAnd then people actually offering illegal fixes\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/1n8hbu/i_dream_the_day_chrome_will_finally_render_fonts/ccgkbly\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/988353\nFontSquirrel actually has Helvetica Neue on their ban list to prevent this.\nAnd those are just a few of the people who managed to do their research and actually come forward.

I've found posts around the web that seem to agree with me and provide hints at how to make it work, which I've followed.\nBeyond the above question, I've run into an issue with this where padding is taken into account for the width(yes, I know box-sizing: border-box is used everywhere), and that's causing the transition to jump at the end.  Here's a JSFiddle demonstrating it; http://jsfiddle.net/w6CEc/1/.  In short, the sidebar will overshoot it's target when expanding.  After lots of messing with this, I believe it's because of the padding and how the width is calculated(set it to 0 with 15px padding on each side, and it'll try to calculate the content width as -30px which would be truncated to 0 and leave the padding visible.\nI have a possible fix for this, but I wanted to see if anyone else has run into this issue or thought about a fix.  I believe the issue is how jquery handles the border-box calculation when using $.width().  If you use $.css('width'), it doesn't seem to exhibit the same behavior.

Although this approach works fine for screenreader users, it is not adequate for another class of users that benefit from this: sighted keyboard-only users.\nThis user group needs the skip link to become at least visible, in an obvious/expected location (usually top/left of the document), when focus is set to it. Otherwise, with the  method, sighted keyboard users will do a first  into the invisble skip link and not actually realise it's a skip link (unless they watch the browser's hint in the bottom toolbar).\nMy initial idea was to just add a new class at the end of scaffolding.css, a la\n.skiplink {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 1px;\n  height: 1px;\n  margin: -1px;\n  padding: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  clip: rect(0,0,0,0);\n  border: 0;\n}\n\n:focus.skiplink {\n  // undo the hiding\n  width: auto;\n  height: auto;\n  margin: 0;\n  overflow: auto;\n  clip: auto;\n  // some explicit visual styles\n  display: block;\n  background: #eee;\n  color: #000;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  padding: 1em;\n}\nbut then held off because this would seem to be a super-specific bit of CSS - only really applicable to a skip link that is shown at the top of a document, due to its default position once focused - and also because it carries actual visual styling (to avoid having a link just floating over the rest of the page, potentially making it hard/impossible to actually see) which is probably out of place in the actual scaffolding.\nSo, wondering what the best approach here would be? Adding a very specific bit of CSS to bootstrap? Or should this simply be fixed in the prose for http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#accessibility ? For instance, for the latter, it's conceivable to expand the advice to say that although we'll just reuse the  class that's nominally just for screenreader users, there is this other group that needs to see the link on focus, so specifically for the skip link we should also add a :focus state that undoes the actual hiding mechanisms of  and, in addition, gives it some necessary (opaque background) and visually appealing (ideally consistent with whatever design the site has) style? Adding an explicit  to the example code, and then providing further CSS like so:\n<body>\n  <a href=\"#content\" id=\"skiplink\" class=\"sr-only\">Skip to main content</a>\n  <div class=\"container\" id=\"content\">\n    The main page content.\n  </div>\n</body>\n#skiplink:focus {\n  // undo the hiding\n  width: auto;\n  height: auto;\n  margin: 0;\n  overflow: auto;\n  clip: auto;\n  // some explicit visual styles\n  display: block;\n  background: #eee;\n  color: #000;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  padding: 1em;\n}\nThoughts?\n", "\nhttp://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/customize.html\ngave me blank bootstrap.css an js file.\n", "\ntoday I have a problem with space in breadcrumb which space in  breaks to new line\nplease change the\n\nto\n\n", "\nI noticed a weird behaviour when using table-bordered in Firefox...\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/B3CWR/3/\nThis is a very specific issue only in FF so I'm not sure if yall want to address it but this does fix it:\n\nthead+tbody:before{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0content:\" \";\n}\n\n(The proposed fix actually makes the border-width bigger so I guess it's not a fix)\n", "\nI've noticed that Bootstrap doesn't change it font sizes between layouts.

It seems like I would have to rewrite a lot of code in my main.scss in my own media queries in order to do this.  A related part of the problem is that, for example, the H1, H2, H3, etc font sizes are defined as calculated pixels:\n\nIf Bootstrap was using s then you could simply change the base font size in each media query and all headers (in this example) would automatically change size accordingly.\nAnyways, just trying to figure out the best approach here and also am wondering why in the world font sizes would not be setup to be responsive...\n", "\nUpon opening the collapsable element in Safari 7, after the opening animation completes the element quickly closes and opens up again.

Obviously if you're hand-coding the site then you can adjust the copy to fit, but in a dynamic application with translations into more verbose languages you can't always plan it so well.\nSetting nowrap on the text (though only above the point that it switches to horizontal display) makes it break in a slightly different way, with the extra text escaping the nav and continuing off the right hand side in a single line. I generally prefer it, but I suppose it's a judgment call as to what's most  appropriate in most cases.\nThe point where it breaks (either with or without nowrap) can be put off slightly longer by removing the left and right padding on each nav item (inherited from .nav > li > a ). Since the text is centered in the justified nav that padding doesn't have much visible impact until space starts getting tight. So you can trade-off the tabs getting a bit squashed together at certain size/text combinations against breaking onto a new line or breaking out to the left.\n", "\nI've been playing around with the new RTL support, one thing I noticed is that sometimes you might use glyphicon arrows pointing to the right or left to mean \"backwards\" and \"forwards\" e.g. a button to take you to the next step in a process, which I guess (since I only speak English, and don't know that much about RTL internationalization) would need to be flipped when using RTL languages.\nAs I say, not an expert, but maybe a glyphicon-chevron-forwards and -backwards (and so on for other \"pointy\" icons like the hand) that flipped automatically with the current text direction would be one solution.\nWhen searching to see if this was already mentioned, I found an old bug #282  that made a similar point about tooltips and popovers.\n", "\n is not useful for our Bower package, so should it be ignored?\n", "\nHello,\nfor a future version is it possible to add in navbar dropdow the possibility to add checkbox to select multiple value and have a submit button or link (i used it for make filter) like this sample\n\n", "\nReally confused how js plugin works via data-api\n\nI don't understand how initial event click.bs.modal.data-api is triggered...\n", "\nif I use form-control-feedback on input-group with input-group-addon on left position not appear optional icons\nI need set z-index\nexample: jsfiddle\n", "\nHey,\nRecently I've been putting together a page that has a lot of data.

Since they all are classes, we have to either make a copy of the component less file, change it, and include it instead of the original one, or negate already defined properties.\nIf components were defined as mixins, and then in a separate file affected to a class, we could just use the mixin and not import the file in which the class is defined.\nFor example, one might want to use panel for its own markup :\n<div id=\"my-panel\">...</div>\n@import \"panels.less\";\n\n#my-panel {\n  .panel;\n}\nThat works, but in the final CSS, we would end with 2 rule sets, one for .panel, and one for #my-panel.\nThe less file for the panel component, \"panels.less\" contains :\n.panel {\n  margin-bottom: @line-height-computed;\n  background-color: @panel-bg;\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n  border-radius: @panel-border-radius;\n  .box-shadow(0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.05));\n}\nTo make this possible, we could split components in 2 files. One containing the mixin, named e.g. \"panels.mixins.less\" :\n.panel() {\n  margin-bottom: @line-height-computed;\n  background-color: @panel-bg;\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n  border-radius: @panel-border-radius;\n  .box-shadow(0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.05));\n}\nAnd another one, \"panels.less\", affecting the mixin to the default class assumed by bootstrap :\n.panel {\n  .panel;\n}\nThat would make the whole thing more modular and flexible.\nMakes sense ?\n", "\nIs there a way to improve performance on button groups?

When the value is 0 the comparison in the bellow if case is evaluated to false and the element is never cleaned up:\nif (this.unpin) this.$element.css('top', '')\nSo I replaced it with with this block:\nif (this.unpin != null) {\n        this.$element.css('top', '')\n        this.$element.css('position', '')\n}\n", "\nExample: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-justified\nHere you can see that the left edge of the dropdown menu is positioned below the left edge of the first button in the group, instead of below the left edge of the button that triggered the menu.\n(Also, the borders of the buttons that don't have the .dropdown-toggle class disappear in IE8.)\n", "\nI've created a button group with 3 radio buttons inside, acting as toggle buttons.

In Firefox and Chrome, clicking anywhere on the page takes focus away from the button and the button reverts back to its default background.

Maybe jQuery can be used to add an \"active\" class to the button when the menu is expanded.\nThe second issue is an aesthetic one.

(This is the way to tell IE8, for example, to render the page as IE7 or \"IE8 Compatibility Mode\". Also because Document Mode can be set by the user, the webpage, or the server, it's not always obvious if IE is rendering the page with the version you think.)\n\nI would suggest adding something like the following to\nhttp://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#browsers\n\"If you are experiencing problems with IE,\n\nMake sure your page declares its doctype by using the tag  before your  tag.\nTry including the following tag in : .\n\nThis will make sure IE is not rendering the page as an older version of IE. (You can   check the Document Mode IE is using to render the page by opening IE's debugging tools; press F12 and look what is being used for the \"Document Mode\".)\n\nSecondly, on http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template I would suggest moving the\n\n\nout of the head and to right before \nNormally, it works fine in the , but if you start making your own custom CSS media query styling, IE8 won't apply the correct styling until you resize the browser.\n(BTW, don't touch the  tag.

I have the whole thing working perfectly using custom jQuery-based JS code that adds and removes the relevant classes as the field validation succeeds or fails.\nUnder BS 2.3.x, I had used home-brew colorized glyphicon image files, some custom CSS, and the help-inline class for this purpose, but with help-inline's demise and the switch to font-based glyphicons in BS 3, I switched to using input-groups and adjusted my code accordingly.\nThe problem is a minor aesthetic issue with how input-groups containing a glyphicon are rendered in a browser. Whenever the glyphicons appear in the input-group-addon, the whole input-group-addon shifts downward by a couple of pixels in every browser (Mac and Win, including IE 8-11) other than FF. Frankly, it looks tacky.\nIf I use the radical and times HTML entities from a standard webfont instead of a glyphicon, the input-group-addon doesn't shift, but none of the standard web fonts have versions of these entities that look half as good as a glyphicon.\nAnother issue that I would appreciate help with is for you to create a blank glyphicon (glyphicon-blank) that can be used as a placeholder in a stateless input-group-addon so the input-group-addon won't change sizes as the checkmark or X appear.\nI created a stub page to illustrate the problems at:\n\nA working example of a production form using my technique is at:\n\nIf the site asks you to authenticate, the username is \"dev\" and the password is \"dev123\".

This effectively overrides any styling that was previously done through the  attribute (which may be fair game) and styling done through the application of CSS stylesheets.\nThe fiddle gives a horizontal example but the issue is the same in either dimension. Also, while the fiddle uses the grid system, this happens whenever the CSS sets a specific dimension on the element which is to be collapsed and the collapsing is set to happen on this same dimension. So this is not a grid-dependent issue.\nA quick edit of the boostrap.js file I have here shows that simply removing the dimension (width or height) from the CSS of the element is enough to get the expected behavior.

The only solution is to create a custom version of this method which uses Bootstrap-specific templates (more or less what TwitterBootstrapMvc is doing), or resort to Javascript to add the class to all input elements afterwards (as mentioned in this SO post).\nThe ASP.NET MVC5 template now comes bundled with Bootstrap 2, which is awesome, but I'm really wondering whether it'll be possible / desirable for them to support Bootstrap 3 - solely because of this unfortunate issue...

The desired result is that once a user clicks the submit button, the button is immediately disabled and remains disabled until the dialog is destroyed, but in the meantime the button state gets updated to indicate the status of the save request (e.g., maybe \"Processing...\", \"Saving...\", \"Saved\", etc).\nBootstrap does not provide a good way to do this. The problem is that setting the button state to anything other than \"loading\" will enable the button after the current event stack has been processed.\n(The only workarounds that I'm aware of involve a hack using setTimeout to set the \"disabled\" attribute again after it is enabled, or to set the text of the button without setting the state, neither of which is desirable.)\n(This is a duplicate of #3034, but that issue was closed a year ago for lack of detail.)\nA rough, simplified example of the problem do can be seen at:\nhttp://bootply.com/84160\nThe Bootstrap code in question is:\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/button.js\nlines 35-53, in the Button.prototype.setState method.\nAlso pasted at:\nhttp://codepaste.dev7studios.com/item/ml2kpybyn\nThe problem appears to be two-fold. One problem is that the code setting the disabled state of the button is located inside a call to setTimeout(function () {...}, 0), placing it at the end of the current event stack. The other is that setting the button to any state other than 'loading' will cause the button to be enabled. If either of these was fixed, the workaround would be easy.\nI think the \"best practice\" solution would be to allow the devloper to control the enabled/disabled state of the button when setting the state, which could be easily accomplished one of two ways:\n\nAdding an additional parameter to the setState method. (Maybe a flag to indicate the button's state? Or an object defining additional options to set for the button?)\nAccepting an additional data attribute in the html for the button. For instance:\n\nbeing triggered by\n\nwould set the text to \"Whatever\" and disable the button\n\n", "\nIt would be great if it was possible to use\n<td class=\"info\">...</td>\nand end up with a blue line in your table.\n", "\nMatch the style of the inter button borders to that of the other design options, so that the size remains constant in all the group elements.\n", "\nTo reproduce just resize the browser window.\nhere is an example:\nhttp://gyazo.com/2c88ff9c90c68073db47f52ea00c5292\n", "\nIt's an unusual experiment, but it can lead to a somewhat strange result:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/cgeF2/\nDoesn't seem to me like that's the desired outcome.\n", "\nwhat is the purpose of the propriety margin-left:-15px, and margin-right:-15px; in row class?

Visual inspection of the files on the wip branch tells me the issue has not disappeared since 3.0.0 RC2 .)\nThe following scenarios refer to the fiddle above.\nScenario 1\nIf you load the fiddle and click on the panel headers and don't touch the two buttons at the bottom, when expanding one panel, the other collapses. This is the expected behavior.\nScenario 2\nHowever, if you load the fiddle and then click the \"Trigger it programmatically\" button. Panel B will expand without panel A collapsing.

Then, hit \"Trigger it programmatically\". It works as expected: panel A collapses, panel B expands.\nDiscussion\nWhat happens in Scenario 2 is that when the  function is called, the element appears to be some random collapsible element not part of a group of panels that should be coordinated together. There is no information on the element itself to tell  that there is a  associated with this element.\nThis is confirmed by scenario 4. There, the click on the \"Panel B\" heading triggers , which causes the collapsible element to acquire a  object which is properly initialized. From that point on, it is possible to call  on that element and get proper behavior but that's only because the user first clicked on the heading.\nThis is also confirmed by the workaround which consists in duplicating the information already present in the HTML so that the  object is created properly. There is another workaround in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lddubeau/6uzL6/ This fiddle contains a modified HTML where the  attribute is set on both the toggles and on their targets.\nIf the  attribute were specified on the element that actually collapses rather than on the toggle (and modify  to seek the  information from its target) it would avoid having to duplicate the information either in the JS or in the HTML.\n", "\nTested on Chrome:\n\nWhen the menu is not collapsed, the carousel looks fine:\n\nI did a quick fix that seems to work:\n\nAfter my hacky fix:\n\nHowever, I'm sure there is a better solution.\nThis bug is probably related to #9901 except that the carousel controls are in the correct place at all times (with the carousel itself).\n", "\nNavigation men\u00fa is not in the correct position with IE10 in V3.0.\nV3.0:\n\nV2.3.2:\n\n", "\nhttp://getbootstrap.com/examples/non-responsive/\nTypography is responsive (play with desktop browser window size)\nThe container is responsive (chrome/nexus4)\n\n", "\nWhen using a customized version of Bootstrap 3.0 the Glyph icons don't work.

Meiert): ... Indicate directionality by the dir attribute on the html element ... Avoid a separate RTL style sheet; find all declarations that specify anything specific to the left or right ... customize those declarations, and use some hook to apply them\u2014like e.g. setting id=\"rtl\" on the body element (well, you really want to use html[dir=\"rtl\"]). article here.\nAnother popular approach is to prefix all RTL rules with a .rtl class (and possibly .ltr for base rules, to prevent overrides). per #3133, #6423, and the less-bidi model.\n\nI'd suggest using an approach than could satisfy these different requirements by simple customizations.\n\nI suggest keeping the RTL rules in a separate css file. Clearly, merging them into a single stylesheet (when required) would be a single copy-paste at the end of the base css.\nI suggest using overrides (vs mixins, or automated tools) in a separate .less file. Then, adding any combination of prefixes, or  rules is as easy as a few lines of .less code. example:\n\n\nor\n\n", "\nI think @component-active-bg needs a counterpart called @component-active-color so the contrast between background color and text can be controlled.

They allow me to beautifully present slightly longer forms in a table-like visual structure.\nA common pattern that I use is that I would like to present static/constant data within my form. A use case is that I have an account page where I don't allow changing the username, but would allow the user to change the password. Other examples are database ID:s, UUID:s etc. My guess that this is also a common use case for other Bootstrap users.\nOne solution to overcome the above issue would be to simply set  or . My issue with these solutions is twofold:\n\nBy the look of them, they both hint to my user that there is a way to edit the username. They both kinda look like input boxes, but are grayed out and inmodifiable.\nAs of semantics, they are both contained in  tags. As a developer, it feels weird putting constants in  tags. They are clearly not input.\n\nAnother possible solution (modified from the documentation) is\n<form class=\"bs-docs-example form-horizontal\">\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputUsername\">Username</label>\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      JensRantil\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"inputPassword\">Password</label>\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      <input type=\"password\" id=\"inputPassword\" placeholder=\"Password\">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"control-group\">\n    <div class=\"controls\">\n      <label class=\"checkbox\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\"> Remember me\n      </label>\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn\">Sign in</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</form>\nwhich yields\n\n.

So far, I haven't understood whether any of them should cover my case.\nIf  is for the case of presenting constants, then I would propose Boostrap would style  as regular text without borders etc. However since I can't defer that from the spec, my proposal is a class that avoids the artefact in the screenshot, a  class with correct margin..\nI'd love to hear your input on this.\n", "\nWhen test thumbnails on small screen sizes, there are a problem.

See full complex example at the end if you like code.\nFull version\nSince LESS has now a nice way to interpolate selector names (see http://lesscss.org/#-selector-interpolation), why not take advantage of it to allow users to rename any selector just like they can change any color?\nThe idea would be to have a file  or whatever, containing stuff like:\n@btn-selector: btn;\n@btn-default-selector: btn-default;\n@btn-primary-selector: btn-primary;\n...\nAnd then impact other LESS files (like ):\n.@{btn-selector} { ... }\n\n.@{btn-default-selector} {\n  .btn-pseudo-states(@btn-default-color, @btn-default-bg, @btn-default-border);\n}\n\n.@{btn-primary-selector} {\n  .btn-pseudo-states(@btn-primary-color, @btn-primary-bg, @btn-primary-border);\n}\n...\nWhy this might be useful? One common use case would be people who prefer having \"enhancements\" on their elements rather than writing the same stuff multiple times. For example, having  can be seen as \"I have a button, which is a primary button and also a large button\". Maybe you would prefer writing  which can be seen as \"I have a button which is primary and large\".\nHow would you achieve that use the selector renaming? Just edit  with:\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\"btn.primary\");\n@btn-large-selector: e(\"btn.large\");\nWe need a little trick, using the  function that will only escape the string to allow a  inside the selector. This will output:\n.btn.primary {\n  .btn-pseudo-states(@btn-primary-color, @btn-primary-bg, @btn-primary-border);\n}\n\n.btn.large {\n  padding: @padding-large-vertical @padding-large-horizontal;\n  font-size: @font-size-large;\n  border-radius: @border-radius-large;\n}\nI don't know about you, but I find it really cool. And it's fully backward compatible of course since it would compile the exact same CSS file as the current one with the correct default values in .\nWhat do you guys think about it? I can do the PR of course, but since I'm a lazy guy, I wanted to see if the concept could fit in Bootstrap before refactoring all that code.\nWhat about mixins?\nHey, wait, can we use interpolated selectors as mixins?... Hemmm... Not really right now, see cloudhead/less.js#1196. That's quite sad and I really hope it will be fixed in a near future. Discovering that, I was thinking \"Damn, does renaming selector is worth loosing mixins?\". Obvisouly not. It is cool but mixins are cooler.\nBut there is already a place were Bootstrap is using selector interpolation and that's the grid! That's why you cannot use a mixin named  even if the  exists. Currently, in order to solve this, Bootstrap has introduce mixins like  and . So one solution would be to do the same for every components: ,  and so on... I don't it find so bad, it makes a clear distinction between what is a mixin and what is a CSS class.\nHopefully, in the future, LESS will support mixin interpolation and those will no longer be required.\nGoing deeper\nOk, so that was the main concept. In the same time, I've been thinking about a few points that I'm not sure would be good or not...\nOne is enforcing a  before all selectors. As you can see in the previous example, there is always a  before the selector interpolation. But we could have get rid of it with:\n@btn-selector: e(\".btn\");\n@btn-default-selector: e(\".btn-default\");\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\".btn-primary\");\n\n@{btn-selector} {...}\n@{btn-default-selector} {...}\n@{btn-primary-selector} {...}\nThis would work as expected but it starts to be a bit ugly in . The main benefit is allowing really any possible selector, including ids, but not sure this would be a good idea.\nAnother one it trying to take advantages of prefixes. Most of Bootstrap selectors are prefixed, like all . Maybe we could try to allow user to override only the prefix if that's what they want... The code I wrote to achieve that it starting to get a bit complex in my opinion but it would be hidden from users anyway... So check a full example at the end of the issue, you can copy/paste it in http://less2css.org/ and play with it. Keep in mind that's the complex version. We could get rid of the prefix concept and only write basic string (except it would be exactly string... strings without quotes!)\nBasic concept\n// selectors.less\n@btn-selector: btn;\n@btn-default-selector: btn-default;\n@btn-primary-selector: btn-primary;\n@btn-large-selector: btn-large;\n\n// Here is what the user can do to override some selectors\n// Let's say he wants to write \"btn primary\" instead of \"btn btn-primary\"\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\"btn.primary\");\n// Or even better\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\"@{btn-selector}.primary\");\n\n// buttons.less\n.@{btn-selector} {\n  content: \"The default btn class\";\n}\n.@{btn-default-selector} {\n  content: \"The gray default button\";\n}\n.@{btn-primary-selector} {\n  content: \"The blue primary button\";\n}\n\n.@{btn-large-selector} {\n  content: \"The big large button\";\n}\nConcept with prefix support\n// selectors.less\n// Put the dash inside the prefix so we can have prefix without dash if required\n// Important: prefix can be a String since it is easier to use it that way\n// but selectors should never be String otherwise it will interpolate a real\n// String with quotes inside the generated CSS\n@btn-prefix:\"btn-\";\n\n// By convention, lets say that the default selector is the prefix\n// without any strange caracter at the end\n@btn-selector: ~`@{btn-prefix}.replace(/[-_]$/, \"\")`;\n\n// And then, all selectors are prefixed with... the prefix!\n@btn-default-selector: e(\"@{btn-prefix}default\");\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\"@{btn-prefix}primary\");\n@btn-large-selector: e(\"@{btn-prefix}large\");\n\n// Here is what the user can do to override some selectors\n// Let's say he wants to write \"btn primary\" instead of \"btn btn-primary\"\n// but keeping the \"btn\" value from the prefix one\n@btn-primary-selector: e(\"@{btn-selector}.primary\");\n\n// buttons.less\n.@{btn-selector} {\n    content: \"The default btn class\";\n}\n.@{btn-default-selector} {\n    content: \"The gray default button\";\n}\n.@{btn-primary-selector} {\n    content: \"The blue primary button\";\n}\n\n.@{btn-large-selector} {\n    content: \"The big large button\";\n}\n", "\nHey guys,\nI did installed bootstrap through bower with\n\nwhich works like charm.

(You can see this at this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/notwebsafe/rRTwF/2/)\nFor most use cases, this is probably fine--it's no big deal to process both change events since the last one will win anyway.

I want to switch the field back to the label as soon as the user commits something from the typeahead dropdown. However, if I do this by listening to the change event, I get the change event from the native side (before the typeahead has filled in the selected value from the dropdown), so I get the wrong content and then destroy the input field, which kills the dropdown before it ever gets a chance to process the click event.\nI currently have a grotesque hack for this (basically, set a timeout so I can see if we get a second change event before deciding to commit), but that's probably fragile.

What do I mean with this? You probably know inuit.css. It provides a skeleton for CSS frameworks and presets some common gui elements like buttons.

It would make theming Bootstrap a lot (!) easier. For now I have to overwrite Bootstrap styles, if I want my own styles.\nYou could ask me why I don't use iniut.css, if I only need the css skeleton? Good question! I begin rapid prototyping of my apps with \"vanilla\" bootstrap and add custom styles as my project moves on. Therefor I do want to use plain Bootstrap styles, too. And additionally Bootstrap comes with several features iniut.css doesn't have (e.g. mixins for polyfilling CSS3 features).\nAnd I think this would make debugging and developing Bootstrap easier, too.\n(I have another minor feature request which doesn't deserve its own issue: Please exclude all polyfills from mixins.less into its own polyfills.less.

I use Twitter/Bootstrap 2.1 from its gem for RoR, running on Apache2 and Passenger.\nWhen I make a request for my page with a scrollspy anchor in the URL, the div gets scrolled alright to said anchor, but it seems that scrollspy mistakes the anchor for the first anchor.\nHow to reproduce:\nGiven the following setup:\n\nAccess the URL for the second anchor: .\nExpected behavior:\nThe page gets loaded with the div properly scrolled to \"anch-b\" and the corresponding topbar button (2nd one) active. Scrolling up would still activate the 1st topbar button, and scrolling down would still activate the 3rd one, and further down would activate the 4th one.\nActual behavior:\nThe page gets loaded with the div properly scrolled to \"anch-b\", but the 3rd topbar button (corresponding to \"anch-c\") is active. Scrolling up to \"anch-a\" activates the 2nd (\"anch-b\") button instead of the 1st one, while scrolling down to \"anch-c\" activates the 4rth (\"anch-d\") one instead of the 3rd one. Scrolling further down to \"anch-d\" and back up to \"anch-c\" keeps the 4th one activated, and then up to \"anch-b\" activates the 3rd one again, etc\u00e6tera.\nNotice that this happens on page load, for instance upon typing the URL with anchor in the browser. It does not happen upon actually clicking on the topbar buttons, because it only scrolls client-side without reloading the page.\nAdditionally, it is unlikely to be related to RoR, since anchors in URLs are invisible to the Rails engine.\nI am using a temporary workaround:\n\nPlease advise.

If checked out as a git submodule directly from twitter/bootstrap, modifications can be made using custom less files in other paths while maintaining / preserving the bootstrap source.  This makes updates easier -- less copy / paste.\nMake File Solution\nIf the source were maintained as a single git repo, modifying the make file to generate / copy clean v.2.1.x js, images and less files to a target path would be a good compromise.  One does not want all the doc files (including custom less and mustache templates) littering, say, their Django static media paths (e.g. /css, /less, /js, /imgs).\nMine is a specific example, but #1096 hinted at similar questions / issues with the repo setup.\nRegardless -- thx for all you guys do.

After an event fires, it uses this cache to filter and do other tricks:\njquery.js:3174: // This is called right after the \"transitionend\" event is actually fired\u2026\nI               dispatch: function( event ) {\n\nThe call to _data retrieves the internal cache. The code then indexes into that cache to find the event type using the event type returned from the actual event. Unfortunately, the event types don't match up (event.type returns \"transitionend\", but jQuery's internal data cache only has \"MSTransitionEnd\", and since the index fails with undefined, the empty array is used instead. As a result, the actual associated handler is never invoked\nTo Get Ready for Windows 8 and IE10:\nCurrently IE10 only exists in Windows 8 which is scheduled to be released October 26.

It is not acceptable to suggest \"Third party plugin support is never guaranteed.\". It is good practice to enforce css classes and selectors to be specific to the framework, constantly being aware of possible impacts outside of the framework. Just as namespaces are essential to JavaScript programming and being careful about the use of global variables, regardless of what framework, for example jQuery has addressed that appropriately, BS also needs to be cognizant of outside ramifications. I simply cannot accept that the code below cannot be expressed more granularly and to expect us (the users of BS) to customize the css to address this is not the correct approach.

Please consider doing the same in your projects.\n\nI am not a lawyer, but the phrase \"has granted us use of the Halflings set\" suggests to me (and my colleagues) that only the Bootstrap project has been granted a special license and that users of the toolkit would be subject to Glyphicons' normal license. Someone recently proposed a question of the Halflings set's license to Glyphicons on Twitter and the response was ambiguous but seemed to suggest that any attribution was acceptable when using Glyphicons with the Bootstrap toolkit:\n\nIf it's not possible to include a link back to glyphicons.com, it would be right to have any license, but it's up to you.\n\nPlease update the Bootstrap website and/or the LICENSE file distributed with the source to expicitly state the license terms for the Glyphicons Halflings set when used with Bootstrap, whatever those terms may be.

Problem is I can't to that with Bootstrap files so if I want the whole Bootstrap pack I need to include 12 more .js files to my page which I don't really want to do.\nIs there a solution yet or ?\n", "\nWhen the following (tablet) media queries are removed from the css:\n@media (max-width: 768px)\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 980px)\nthe media query for max-width: 480px smartphones remains at the default mode when resizing browser smaller than 480px.

The expected behavior is to close when they lose focus, so clicking anywhere on the page should close them.\nPopvers and tooltips behave similarly, except the only way to close them is to click on another anchor element. This is far worse than the issue with dropdowns, as users have no way to close the overlay without activating some other function on the page. Even clicking on the trigger element does nothing.\nThis issue can easily block page content with no clear/easy solution for users.\nI would imagine, after digging through the javascript, that this has to do with how jQuery detects click events on iOS. It only triggers the event on anchor elements. For example, on this jsfiddle, the event only triggers when you click on the anchor, regardless of what is bound to the event.\nCould someone also verify this on an Android device?\n", "\nIf the navbar's position is fixed (e.g. > 980px screen width), then jumping to a in-page anchor link places the initial content for that anchor under the navbar where it is, therefore, hidden from the user.\n", "\nIcon classes are echoed via CSS in the Docs.

I see that there are related issues that appear to be casually dismissed despite real world problems being caused by these missing semicolons.
